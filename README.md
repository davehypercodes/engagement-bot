**Twitter Bot Documentation**

**Introduction:**

This documentation outlines the usage and setup of a Twitter bot designed to extract links from a specified Twitter group and engage with them by liking, retweeting, and quoting. The bot is intended to automate interactions on Twitter, specifically targeting links within a designated group.

**Installation Process:**

1. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment(Termninal):**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code by selecting Terminal > New Terminal from the top menu.
   - Create a virtual environment using the following command:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```
     .\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
     **Set Up Virtual Environment(VS Code)**
     - Press `Ctrl + shift + p` to toggle the vs command panel
     - type `Python` and click on select python interpreter
     - In the dropdown select create virtual environment and choose `.venv`
     - Selct the python Interpreter to be used in your virtual environment`

3. **Install Selenium:**
   - While the virtual environment is activated, install Selenium using pip:
     ```
     pip install selenium
     ```

**Usage:**

1. **Open the Code:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Open the Python script containing the Twitter bot code.

2. **Modify Group Name:**
   - Locate the variable containing the name of the Twitter group to extract links from.
   - Modify the group name according to your requirement. By default, it's set to `$BEYOND`.

3. **Select Engagement Actions:**

   - If you wish to remove quoting functionality, locate the list of engagement commands and remove `'quote'` from it.

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
   - Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
   - Run the Python script containing the bot's code:
     ```
     python bot_script.py
     ```

**Functionality:**

- **Extracting Links:**
  - The bot will access the specified Twitter group and extract links from its posts.

- **Engagement:**

- Ensure your Twitter account credentials are provided in a secure manner within the code.
- Be mindful of Twitter's usage policies to avoid any potential violations.
- Regularly check the bot's activity to ensure it's functioning as expected and adjust parameters accordingly.

**Conclusion:**

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for installing, configuring, and using the Twitter bot within Visual Studio Code for automating interactions within specified Twitter groups.
